# Tissue-Specific_Codon_Optimization_DL_Model

Abstract:

Protein translation is the process by which messenger RNA templates are read by ribosomes and decoded into polypeptide chains consisting of amino acids. This universal mechanism is found in all life forms; however, translational regulation varies among species. These differences can affect the design of protein-based drugs, especially those that are manufactured through heterologous expression platforms like bacteria or yeast. The amino acid sequence of a protein is defined by the DNA that encodes it. Amino acids are encoded by three consecutive bases called codons. Codon usage can differ between species, resulting in species-related biases. Consequently, efficient expression of recombinant proteins, including secretory proteins, often requires codon optimization. Publicly available tools for codon optimization, while convenient, do not always result in higher expression levels and can lead to protein misfolding in a tissue-dependent manner. In this study, we aimed to develop a novel deep learning (DL) method using a recurrent neural network (RNN) to define cell type-dependent codon biases. Using gene expression data from three different mouse tissues (brain, liver, and muscle), we trained DL models to predict optimal codon usage for each cell/tissue type. Additionally, we used secretory genes to develop models tailored for human and mouse expression systems. Codon-optimized sequences for firefly luciferase, enhanced green fluorescent protein, and Gaussia luciferase exhibited enhanced protein expression compared to their original sequences and those optimized using a commercially available tool. Interestingly, DL models trained on genes expressed in liver cells (hepatocytes) resulted in the highest levels of expression when tested in vitro, irrespective of the cell type. Our findings also demonstrate that DL-based codon optimization algorithms can significantly enhance protein translation, particularly for secretory proteins, which are crucial for therapeutic applications. This research represents a novel approach to codon optimization with broader implications for protein-based pharmaceuticals, vaccine manufacturing, gene therapy, and other recombinant DNA products.
